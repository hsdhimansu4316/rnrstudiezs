Even though the GMAT is for MBA admissions, students need not study management. GMAT assesses basic math and linguistic skills required for B-School. Students without management experience should not worry about GMAT preparation. Students with logical skills can take the GMAT." },

Though GMAT is administered year-round, individual exam centers may have date deviations. GMAT exam dates fill up quickly, so students may not always have their preferred day." },

Rescheduling your GMAT exam more than seven days before your appointment costs $50; seven days or less costs $250. Remember that GMAT appointments cannot be rescheduled or canceled within 24 hours." },
